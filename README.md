When administering your own injections, it's important to vary your injection
sites as much as possible — doing an injection is trauma (in the medical
sense), and if you don’t switch it up you’ll develop scar tissue. But how to
remember where to inject each week? I read online to write it down on a
calendar, but I’m not going to college for computer science for nothing!

    $ python ./injection_scheduler.py
    Inject on left leg, near the middle (towards butt). Good luck and stay
    safe!
